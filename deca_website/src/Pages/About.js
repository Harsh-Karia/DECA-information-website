					<h1>Competitions</h1>
					<h3>Competitions are the main event of the DECA experience, offering a platform to showcase skills and network. DECA organizes competitive events across four distinct career clusters: business management and administration, finance, hospitality and tourism, marketing, and additionally also in entrepreneurship and personal financial literacy. There are various different even types such as role-play and case study events, and prepared events. However, this year we will not be competing, as the dates for ICDC coincides with Picnic Day. Additionally, the event's location in Austin, TX, poses logistical challenges, as it requires quite a lot of funds for travel and accommodation. As we are still a relatively new club, we have decided not to compete this year especially as we are still in the process of accumulating funds to be able to cover the majority of memberâ€™s expenses. We are still hoping to provide a valuable experience mimicking the benefits of ICDC. </h3>
